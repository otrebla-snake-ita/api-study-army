## DISCLAIMER

This is a simple project for learning purpose, and by no means I support any war.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Given that I love videogames, especially military ones, I started getting a basic interest in military matters.
I am just creating a fake military based API in .NET Core 8. I am trying to extend my personal knowledge in programming matters by creating something that has some learning value for me.

### GENERAL STRUCTURE

It is my intention to follow a Clean Architecture pattern, by separating the application layers by following best practices.
